Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined in filed generated by Typescript<br>
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42497479/uncaught-referenceerror-exports-is-not-defined-in-filed-generated-by-typescript<br>
For solving this TypeScript bug, just add '<script> var exports = {}; </script>' to each HTML that is rendered with .js files containing the line 'exports.__esModule = true;', which, in turn, originates from the use of ES6+ modules at the correspondent .ts files. TypeScript compiler shouldn't generate that line on the compiled .js files. While TypeScript compiler is not fixed regarding this issue, just add that additional script line at the HTML files, declaring the useless and empty var 'exports', and thus this wrong error will not be thrown and Electron-generated GUI will work fine. Use "module": "CommonJS" and a "target" greater or equal than 'es6' at tsconfig.json for being able to use ES6 modules, which are the preferable way of importing/exporting elements between javascript files.

Throw Error "NavigationDuplicated"<br>

Importing electron module through "require", inside Vue.js components, and avoiding errors:<br>
When and if having to import electron module and its submodules, as ipcRenderer, from inside a Vue component, to avoid the errors "Uncaught TypeError: fs.existsSync is not a function" and "'Electron' is not defined", as well as to be able to set the types of the objects' variables correctly, instead of using "any" type, do the following:
- use the ES6 "import" / "from" simply to have the Electron types defined, not to extract the objects. This is for being able to use "typeof Electron.submoduleType". If setting the types after the ":" of the variables, you don't need this
- use the CommonJS "require" for importing the module and submodules, extract the objects, and then set each variable type using the Electron types - either using the ":" or "typeof" - for setting the types on the variables of the electron objects, extract these mannually from the required electron object and not through destructuring
- disable the respective eslint rule, by setting "'@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires': 0" at .eslintrc.js file, in order to allow the use of "require" 
- call the "require" always on the "window" object
- set "nodeIntegration: true" at the webPreferences of the that window at the background.ts file
- set "module": "CommonJS" at the tsconfig.json (to be able to use Electron interface types)
- do not deploy that at the web server through "npm run serve", only use "npm run electron:serve", except after you adapt the project for a web version, eliminating Electron modules and code from it
