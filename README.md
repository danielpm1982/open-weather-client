[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is an Open Weather REST API client app created with Node.js, npm, Vue-cli, Vue.js, JavaScript ES6+, TypeScript and Electron.js .<br>
The objective of this project is simply to demonstrate how to use these technologies. This app basically access a REST weather API (OpenWeather - current weather), retrieves the result for the requested city and shows to the user.<br>
It is a multi-platform desktop app that runs natively on Linux, Windows or iOS, according to the respective distro, and has the GUI components rendered by Electron from the html, css and .js files (compiled from the .ts files).<br>

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
